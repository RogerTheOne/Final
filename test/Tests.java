 ANSWER HERE:


 * 2b. Implement the unit tests below (after all these comments).
 *
 * 3. Debug the issues causing your tests to fail.
 *    There are at least a couple bugs in the code.
 *    Add more unit tests if necessary.
 *    List bugs you found and fixed below.  Give
 *    - a brief description of each bug
 *    - method where the bug occurs
 *    - how you fixed the problem
ANSWER HERE:


* 4a.  Identify three (3) locations in the code where assertions
*      are appropriate. Give

*    - a brief description of each issue
*    - the method where the issue is
*    - how to fix the issue
ANSWER HERE:


* 6b. Perform the refactorings on the code.  Be sure to do
*     regression testing
*
* 7. Identify three (3) class-level refactorings that can be
